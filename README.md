## Semantic Versioning 2.0.0

### Summary

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging
[semver.org](https://semver.org/)

The general format is: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, eg. `1.0.1`


- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
-  **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
